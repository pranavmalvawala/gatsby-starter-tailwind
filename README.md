Pranav's personal website is built using Gatsby.

## Note

I've made my website open source for your inspiration and curiosity. However, **I highly encourage you to be creative and create your own design, and content.**

However, if you are like me, who just wants to get started as quickly as possible with this design so you don't end up spending more time on designing instead of writing blogs then go ahead, I've create a [gatsby template]() just for this exact purpose.
