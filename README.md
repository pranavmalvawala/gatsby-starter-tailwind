Pranav's personal website is built using Gatsby and tailwindcss

## Note

I've made my website open source for your inspiration and curiosity. However, **I highly encourage you to be creative and create your own design, and content.**

The [Gatsby Starter Tailwind](https://github.com/taylorbryant/gatsby-starter-tailwind) is a great place to start, and is the base for this blog.
