## __A few things you should know__
Use the repo to start your own blog with the same theme.

>Below link points to the source code of this website so you will have to delete my blogs, configs, etc... and put your own details just to get started but I'm planning to create an offical Gatsby theme which will be much easier to install.

I'm not a designer, complete theme is derived from [scttcper/gatsby-casper](https://github.com/scttcper/gatsby-casper). The only difference between the 2 is, gatsby-casper is a community blog, multiple people can have 
profiles and each have there own blog posts while mine happen to be a personal blog.


### Getting Started
Find the source of this blog on [GitHub](https://github.com/pranavmalvawala/pranavmalvawala.com)

__Clone this repo.__
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pranav/pranavmalvawala.com.git --depth=1
```

__Remove .git folder and setup a new one__
```bash
rm -rf .git && git init
```

Now push to whatever repo you want!
